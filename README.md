# Emojicode [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emojicode/emojicode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emojicode/emojicode) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/emojicode/emojicode](https://badges.gitter.im/emojicode/emojicode.svg)](https://gitter.im/emojicode/emojicode?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Emojicode is an open source, high-level, multi-paradigm

## üî® Building from source

If you don‚Äôt want to use the prebuilt binaries, you can of course also build
Emojicode from source.

**These build instructions only apply to the latest code in the master branch.
To build previous versions, please consult the according README.md by cloning
the repository and checking out a version: `git checkout v0.3`**

Prerequisites:

- clang and clang++ 3.4 or newer, or
- gcc and g++ 4.9 or newer
- CMake 3.5.1 and (preferably) Ninja
- Python 3.5.2 or above to pack for distribution and run tests
- Allegro 5 to compile the allegro package
  - `sudo apt-get install liballegro5-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu
  - `brew install allegro` on OS X

Steps:

1. Clone Emojicode (or download the source code and extract it) and navigate
  into it:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/emojicode/emojicode
   cd emojicode
   ```

2.  Create a `build` directory and run CMake in it:

  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -GNinja
  ```

  You can specify the heap size in bytes, which defaults to 512MB, with
  `-DheapSize` and the default package search path with
  `-DdefaultPackagesDirectory` like so:

  ```
  cmake -DheapSize=128000000 -DdefaultPackagesDirectory=/opt/strange/place .. -GNinja
  ```

  You can of course also run CMake in another directory or use another build
  system than Ninja. Refer to the CMake documentation for more information.

3. Build the Compiler and Real-Time Engine:

   ```
   ninja
   ```

4. You can now test Emojicode:

   ```
   ninja tests
   ```

   and take the distribution package created inside the build directory.
