  The sockets package allows you to open TCP sockets to servers or to create a TCP server socket
  yourself.

  The following is a very basic example of opening a TCP socket to make an HTTP request and print
  the first 140 characters of the response.
  ```
  🍦 socket 🍺 🔷📞🆕 🔤www.emojicode.org🔤 🔤80🔤
  💬 socket 📇 🔤GET / HTTP/1.1❌r❌nHost: www.emojicode.org❌r❌n❌r❌n🔤

  🍦 data 🍺 👂 socket 140
  😀 🍺 🔡 data
  ```

  At the time of writing this, the above code would return something similar to:
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Server: GitHub.com
  Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
  Last-Modified: Sat, 29 Oct 2016 11:54:03 GMT
  Access-Control-Al
  ```

  Here we’ve an example of a minimal echo-server that listens on port 8728. The server simply sends
  back a copy of the data it received.
  ```
  🍦 server 🍺 🔷🏄🆕 8728

  🔁 👍 🍇
    🍦 clientSocket 🍺 🙋 server
    🔁 👍 🍇
      🍦 readData 👂 clientSocket 50
      🍊🍦 data readData 🍇
        💬 clientSocket data
      🍉
    🍉
  🍉
  ```
  Of course, the code above is very minimal and incomplete. For example, it can handle only one
  connection.
