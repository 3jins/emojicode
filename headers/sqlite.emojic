        This method binds a given value to the data placeholder number *placeholder#* in a prepared statement.
        
        Be aware of that placeholder indexes start with 1.
        
        *value* must be one of the *bindable types*:
        
        - 🔡
        - 🚂
        - 🚀
        - 📇
        - ✨ (inserts `NULL`)
        
        If the method fails for any reason an error is returned.
