  Represents a region in memory.

  Working with 🧠 requires great care as this interface allows you to directly
  manipulate memory.

  It’s important to understand that instances of 🧠 are basically memory
  addresses. Always think of a 🧠 instance as pointing to a memory
  region. Because 🧠 instance always are addresses it is recommmended that you
  make no more copies than absolutely necessary to avoid unwanted side effects.

  It is not possible to directly manipulate or access memory addresses as this
  would interfer with the automatic memory management Emojicode provides.

    Copies *bytes* bytes from *source* starting from *sourceOffset* to this
    instane, writing the copied bytes *destinationOffset* bytes past the
    beginning of this memory area.

    *source* may be the same as the instance on which the method is called
    and the memory area which is copied may overlap the destination area.
