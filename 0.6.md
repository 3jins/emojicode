# The 🛣 to Emojicode 0.6

Emojicode 0.6 is on its way! Here’s a plan on what needs to be done
to release another version of world’s only emojiful programming language.

[**➡️ Always wanted to improve Emojicode’s syntax? It’s your call!**][1]

## Focus 👁

This release will focus on these changes:

- Enhanced Syntax

  Quite a lot of Emojicode’s syntax is weird. “Why does 🍎 return in a function?” is one of many
  questions you might have asked yourself. This will drastically change.

- Compile to Native Binaries

  The Emojicode Real-Time Engine will be removed and Emojicode packages will be compiled
  to machine code.

- Revamped compiler

  Therefore, naturally, the compiler will be revamped, with features like:

  - Higher resilience in the case of errors (compile as much code as possible, try to fix typos in variables)
  - Caching of whole packages

  Since the compiler will use LLVM, Emojicode gets a lot of optimizations too!

- Updated Packages System

  The packages system needs to be updated too, of course.

## Help improving Emojicode’s syntax! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
