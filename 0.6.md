# The 🛣 to Emojicode 0.6

Emojicode 0.6 is on its way! Here’s a plan on what needs to be done 
to release another version of world’s only emojiful programming language.

[**➡️ Always wanted to improve Emojicode’s syntax? It’s your call!**][1]

## Focus 👁

This release will focus on these changes:

- Enhanced Syntax

  Quite a lot of Emojicode’s syntax is weird. “Why does 🍎 return in a function?” is one of many
  questions you might have asked yourself. This will drastically change.
  
- Overhauled Engine

  The Real-Time Engine works great already but in a somewhat complicated way that
  makes debugging hard. The Real-Time Engine will be completely reworked into a more classical stack
  machine and we’ll eventually change its name to Engine. Simplicity wins.
  
- Revamped compiler

  The compiler will be simplified too and will use a more common architecture. Moreover these features are waiting:
  
  - Higher resilience in the case of errors (compile as much code as possible, try to fix typos in variables)
  - Caching of whole packages
  - Basic Optimization (precompute constants, some basic inlining, dead code elimination)
