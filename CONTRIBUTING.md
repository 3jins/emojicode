# Contributing

You want to improve Emojicode? That's awesome! Before you start, we would like to tell you a few things.

We hope that these guidelines make Emojicode's development as fun as possible for everyone. By following these, you ensure that your and our time is not wasted and we can incorporate your contribution quickly and smoothly.

## Helpful Contributions

Since Emojicode is a rather complex programming language, we need to coordinate and discuss changes to language or any of its default packages. If you want to make a **change to the language or the s package**, we would like to ask you to **open an issue first**, so we can make sure your plans fit Emojicode on the long-term.

## Your First Contribution

Contributing is as easy as

1. Create your own fork of Emojicode.
2. Make changes and test your changes.
3. Send a pull request.

## Some Rules about New Code

- All code should be platform independent and in conformance with ISO C++14.
- Before submitting any pull request, make sure all tests pass. If you add a feature, add tests too.
- Try to follow the coding style established in the file you're editing.

## Commit message

It's a convention that every commit message begins with an emoji. This emojis doesn't have to have any deeper meaning, we just want Emojicode's GitHub page to look nice. Feel free to choose any you like, we advise you, however, to choose emojis wisely and with regard to what people might associate it with.

Otherwise, commit messages should concisely describe the change. The first line should be 50 characters or less. Start with an imperative verb. For instance, `ðŸš¨ Use parameter pack for CompilerError`.
